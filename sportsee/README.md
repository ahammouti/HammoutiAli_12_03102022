SportSee, a startup dedicated to sports coaching. In full growth, the company will today launch a new version of the user profile page. This page will in particular allow the user to follow the number of sessions carried out as well as the number of calories burned.

# How to launch the project :
-   Fork the repository
-   Clone it on your computer.
-   The  `npm i`  command will allow you to install the dependencies.
-   The  `npm start`  command will allow you to run the micro API.


## Step 1. Run the Backend


Run the backend on your terminal in Vscode. Make sure you are in the backend application folder. Then you can run : 

### `npm start`

Now, you should see on the terminal : 

> Magic happens on port 3000.


## Step 2. Run the Frontend

Run the Frontend on your terminal in Vscode. Make sure you are in the Frontend application folder. Then you can run : 

### `npm start`

Now, you should see on the terminal : 

> Compiled successfully!
> 
> You can now view sportsee in the browser.
> 
>   Local:   http://localhost:3001  
> 
> Note that the development build is not optimized. To create a
> production build, use npm run build.

# Getting Started with Create React App

  

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

  

## Available Scripts

  

In the project directory, you can run:

  

### `npm start`

  

Runs the app in the development mode.\

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

  

The page will reload when you make changes.\

You may also see any lint errors in the console.

  

### `npm test`

  

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

  

### `npm run build`

  

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

  

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

Your app is ready to be deployed!

  

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

  

### `npm run eject`

  

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

  

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

  

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

  

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
